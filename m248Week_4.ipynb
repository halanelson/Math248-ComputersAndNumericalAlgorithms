    "## Topic: Sequences $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ and Series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$ of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence of partial sums $\\{s_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ associated with the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$: $s_n=a_1+a_2+\\dots+a_n$ and $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_n$.\n",
    "- Does the series converge or diverge? Why? (Calculus II review, for example $p$-series and alternating series test).\n",
    "- **p-series:** $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p>1$ and diverges otherwise. Check [this link for p-series](http://www.math.drexel.edu/~tolya/p_series.pdf).\n",
    "- If $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=\\infty$, how fast does it blow up (how many terms of the series do we need to add up in order to exceed a certain number)? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Divergent series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=\\infty$ and how fast the divergence happens: \n",
    "- The series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1$ blows up like the sequence $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The harmonic series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$ blows up like $\\ln n$ (very slowly, which makes sense considering that $$\\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{1}{n}=1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\dots+\\frac{1}{N}<\\sum_{n=1}^N1=1+1+1+\\dots+1,$$ and this last series grows like $N$. Recall that $\\ln x$ grows slower than any polynomial, including the polynomial $x$. \n",
    "- To prove that the harmonic series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n}$ diverges *like* $\\ln n$, we can use an integral bound, available from advanced calculus classes. Since $a_n=\\frac{1}{n}$ is positive and decreasing to zero, we have: $$a_n\\le s_n-\\int_1^n a(x)dx\\le a_1.$$ This will give $s_n=\\ln n+C_n$, where $0\\le C_n\\le 1$ (and $C_n\\to C$ as $n\\to\\infty$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## If the series converges $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=L$ we have two questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "a) What is the limit $L$? [This page has a bunch of series limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_series). \n",
    "\n",
    "b) How fast does it get approached (how many terms do you have to add up in the series to get to within a certain small distance from the limit (say $10^{-6}$)? You need to find the first $n$ that satisfies: $|s_n-L|<10^{-6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers:** \n",
    "1. There are a lot of techniques to find the sum of a series analytically: \n",
    "- Taylor series expansions of famous functions, (for example, $e^x, \\ln(1+x), \\cos x, \\sin x, \\frac{1}{1+x}$, Bessel functions, special functions, etc.). \n",
    "- Fourier series techniques.\n",
    "- Contour integration from complex analysis. \n",
    "- Analytically finding a formula for $s_n$ in terms of $n$ then taking the limit as $n\\to\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are formulas and theorems that estimate (give upper and lower bounds) the partial sum $\\{s_n\\}$ in terms of $n$: \n",
    "- For example, for a series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^na_n$ that passes the alternating series test, we have $$|s_n-L|<|a_{n+1}|.$$ So $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\\ln(2)$ needs about $500,000$ to get to within $10^{-6}$ from the limit, while $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}=e^{-1}$ needs only $8$ terms to get the same accuracy. So the former series converges much slower ($\\sim \\frac{1}{n+1}$) than the latter ($\\sim \\frac{1}{(n+1)!}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed of convergence of a series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n=L$ and error analysis (numerical and analytical error analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Idea:** It's usually hard to compute an explicit formula for $s_n=a_1+a_2+\\dots+a_n$ in terms of $n$, but it's easier to bound $s_n$ and hence gain a lot of information about its behavior. So we say $s_n\\to L$ *like* $f(n)\\to 0$ when $|s_n-L|<Cf(n)$ where $C$ is independent of $n$ and $f(n)$ is a sequence converging to zero (ideally, we have a lot of information about $f(n)$ so we know how to deal with it, for example $\\frac{1}{n^\\alpha}, \\frac{1}{n\\ln n}, etc.$).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The error $\\epsilon_n=|s_n-L|$** is the absolute value of the *tail of the series* ($\\sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty a_k$). It gives the distance between the *infinite sum* (which is equal to $L$) and its *finite approximation* $s_n$. This error will decrease as $n$ increases, since the more terms you add from the series, the closer $s_n$ will get to $L$. Hence $\\epsilon_n$ is a sequence that converges to zero. The question is, how fast does this happen, or in other words, how many terms do you need to add from the series to get approximate the limit up to a certain level of accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Two analytical error bounds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Alternating Series:** This works only for alternating series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^ka_k$ that pass the alternating series test:\n",
    "$$\\epsilon_n=|s_n-L|<|a_{n+1}|$$\n",
    "- **Special Positive Series:** $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n$ whose terms are positive (so not alternating) and eventually decreasing:\n",
    "$$\\int_{n+1}^\\infty a(x)dx\\le L-s_n\\le\\int_n^\\infty a(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Knowing the limit $L$ is not necessary to get the error bound (meaning we can still estimate the error without necessarily knowing the value of the limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If no analytical error bound is available, we can *test* some famous forms of bounds *numerically*: $\\frac{1}{n^\\alpha}, \\frac{1}{n^\\alpha(\\ln n)^\\beta}, \\frac{1}{(\\ln n)^\\beta}, \\frac{1}{b^{n^\\alpha}}, etc.$ That is, we can try to numerically *fit* the graph of the sequence $\\epsilon_n$ to one of the above *test sequences*.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The graph of an error that behaves like a power law (that is, $\\epsilon_n\\sim\\frac{1}{n^\\alpha}$) will be a straight line in a $\\log$-$\\log$ plot. The slope of the straight line will give the value of $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. How can we analyze $\\epsilon_n=|s_n-L|$ numerically if we do not have the analytical value of the limit $L$? You can always consider the difference between consecutive terms $g_n=|s_n-s_{n+1}|$. This sequence will also decrease to $0$ as $n$ increases. In fact $g_n=|s_n-s_{n+1}|\\le\\epsilon_n+\\epsilon_{n+1}$ (insert $+L$ and $-L$ then use the triangle inequality). Careful that this only provides a lower bound for $\\epsilon_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In the numerical analysis literature, there are terms like *rate of convergence* and *order of convergence*, which again give a measure of how fast a sequence or series approaches its limit.\n",

    "- Write a program that studies the convergence of the following series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^2}$ to its limit. What is the value of this limit ($\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$)? Make a graph demonstrating the convergence of the sequence of partial sums to this limit.\n",
    "- Show numerically that the convergence is like $n^{-\\alpha}$ and find $\\alpha$. (Hint: Numerically calculate the error vector $\\epsilon_n$, and plot it.
