    "2. Along what important directions is the data mostly spread (directions with most variation in the data)? \n",
    "3. If I think of a matrix $A_{m\\times n}$ as a transformation from the initial space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to the target space $\\mathbb{R}^m$, what is the effect of this matrix on vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$? To which vectors do they get sent to in $\\mathbb{R}^m$?\n",
    "4. What is the effect of this matrix on space itself? Since this is a linear transormation we know there is no space warping, but there is space stretching, squeezing, rotating, reflecting.\n",
    "5. Can we solve the system of linear equations $Ax=b$? What is the best way to go about this? If there is no solution, is there an approximate solution that satisfies our purposes? Notice that here you are looking for the vector $x$ that gets transformed to $b$ when you act on it with $A$.\n",

    "The singular value decomposition can be used to answer all the above quesions. The first two questions are intrinsic to the matrix itself, while the second two questions have to do with the effect of multiplying the matrix with vectors (the matrix acts on space and the vectors in this space). The fifth question has to do with the very important problem of solving systems of linear equations and appears in all kinds of applications.\n",

If the condition number is too large, then it stretches space too much in one direction relative to another direction, and it could be dangerous to do computations in such an extremely stretched space: Solving $Ax=b$ when $A$ has a large condition number will make the solution $x$ unstable in the sense that it is extremely sensitive to perturbations in $b$. A small error in $b$ will result in a solution $x$ that is wildly different than the solution without the error in $b$. It is easy to envision this instability geometrically.\n",

The inetresting part is that if you decide to throw away that very small singular value and hence work in the collapsed space of lower dimension, your computations become perfectly fine. So at the boundaries of extremeness lies normalcy, except in a lower dimension. \n",

These are not diagonalizable, meaning there is no change of basis that can turn them diagonal, however, there is the next closest approach to making them similar to a diagonal matrix, via the singular value decomposition $A=U\\Sigma V^t$. Here $U$ and $V$ are different than each other, and they have orthonormal columns and rows. Their inverse is very easy, since it is the same as their transpose. The singular value decomposition works for both square and non-square matrices. \n",
    "6. For any matrix $A$, $A^tA$ and $AA^t$ happen to both be symmetric positive semi-definite (meaning their eigenvalues are non-negative), so they are diagonalizable with two bases of orthogonal eigenvectors. When we divide by the norm of these orthogonal eigenvectors they become orthonormal. These will be the columns of $V$ and of $U$ respectively. $A^tA$ and $AA^t$ have exactly the same nonnegative eigenvalues, $\\lambda_i=\\sigma_i^2$. Arrange these in decreasing order (keeping the corresponding eigenvector order in $U$ and $V$), and we get the diagonal matrix $\\Sigma$ in the singular value decomposition.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Now if all the eigenvalues of symmetric $A$ happen to be nonnegative, the singular value decomposition of this positive semi-definite symmetric matrix will be the same as its eigenvalue decomposition, provided you normalize the orthogonal eigenvectors in $P$, order them with respect to the nonnegative eigenvalues in decreasing order. So $U=V$ in this case. \n",

Then the singular values $\\sigma_i=|\\lambda_i|=-\\lambda_i$, but now you have to be careful with the corresponding eigenvectors $Av_i=-\\lambda_i v_i=\\lambda_i(-v_i)=\\sigma_iu_i$. This makes $U$ and $V$ in the singular value decomposition unequal. So the singular value decomposition of a symmetric matrix that has some negative eigenvalues can be easily extracted from its eigenvalue decomposition, but it is not exactly the same.\n",

    "In theory, calculating the SVD for a general matrix or the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a square matrix requires solving for the eigenvalues (setting a polynomial=0), then solving a linear system of equations to obtain the eigenvectors. This is very far from being applicable in practice, since the problem of finding the zeros of a polynomial is very sensitive to the variations in the coefficients of the polynomials, so the computational problem becomes very prone to round off errors that are present in the coefficients. We need numerical methods that find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues without having to numerically compute the zeros of a polynomial. We also need to be careful solving a linear system of equations. We need a stable method, or if we use Gaussian elimination ($LU$ decomposition), we need to be careful that the matrix is well conditioned.\n",
